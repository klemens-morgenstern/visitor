The `static_visitor` is resolved at compile time. It may however
be necessary to implement a run-time resolved visitor. Therefore a class template is provided,
`boost::polymorphic_visitor`. This class provides nothing more than an abstract interface
and is declared straight-forward:

```
typedef polymorphic_visitor&lt;void, int, double&gt; poly_vis;
```
 
This declaration provides a polymorphic visitor, which has two operators, 
one for `int` and one for `double`, which return `void`.

If more then one argument shall be used by one operator, they must be put into the
given template `boost::arg_tuple`.

```
typedef polymorphic_visitor&lt;int, arg_tuple&lt;int, int &gt;arg_tuple&lt;double, double&gt;&gt;; 
```

This declares a visitor, which either takes two `int` or two `double`.

[section:tutorial_poly_adapt Polymorhpic Visitor Adaptation]

The example given above only declares interfaces, which can be overloaded by hand.
The library does however provide a solution to adapt a static visitor into a polymorphic one.

```
auto vis = make_functor_visitor(
	std::add&lt;int&gt;(),
	std::negate&lt;int&gt;());

typedef polymorphic_visitor&lt;int, arg_tuple&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; poly_vis;	

auto adapted = adapt_polymorphic_visitor&lt;poly_vis&gt;(vis);
/* the type of adapted is polymorphic_visitor_adapt&ltdecltype(vis), poly_vis&gt;
 * which of course inhertis poly_vis.
 * /
```
This way a `static_visitor` can be passed as an polymorphic visitor very easily.
The `static_visitor` is hold by reference inside the adaptation structure.

[section:tutorial_poly_deduct Polymorhpic Visitor Deduction]

It is also possible to deduce such an interface from a variant. 
This is done via the template `polynomic_visitor_deduction`. 
It needs the return type as the first parameters.

```
typedef variant&lt;int, double&gt; var;
typedef polynomic_visitor_deduction&lt;double, var&gt; vis_if;
//vis_if type is polymorphic_visitor&lt;int, doble&gt;;
```

Since `boost::variant` allows multivisitation, the necessary visitors can also be deduced, 
by passing several variants.

```
typedef variant&lt;int,    double&gt; var1;
typedef variant&lt;string, int&gt; var2;
typedef polynomic_visitor_deduction&lt;double, var1, var2&gt; vis_if;
/*vis_if type is polymorphic_visitor&lt;
	arg_tuple&lt;int, double&gt;,
	arg_tuple&lt;int, string&gt;,
	arg_tuple&lt;double, double&gt;,
	arg_tuple&lt;double, string&gt;,
	&gt;;
```
